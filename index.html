        Not because you're complicated or because you dont like things,<br>but because I set a standard for what I feel you deserve and <br> what I'm willing to give to you. It's difficult to give something meaningful<br>and of value while also 
        trying to keep it at a certain standard. I ultimatetly decided<br> on this since it's something that I know I'm good at and I can give you that will<br> last a lifetime. I love you a whole lot, and I'm sorry I cant give you everything you need<br>
        now, but I am trying and I will continue trying to give you what you deserve. <br><span class="fs-6 fst-italic fw-light">Don't worry there's more.</span>
