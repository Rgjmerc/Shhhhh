        <p class="text-center fs-4">I know you've been wanting a letter. Now my handwriting is very bad <br>so I figured this could be a good solution. <br><br> Lisa to put things simply, I love you. I really do. <br> 
            I love you way more than you know. even when you hate how <br> you look i still admire you're beauty. Even when you want to hide <br>away i still wish i could just stare at you. You dont notice it but i do catch
            <br>myself staring at u in admiration very frequently.  These feelings are true<br> through anything we might experience. You are my first. My first girlfriend, <br> My first kiss,
            My first love, and hopefully My first and last wife. <br>As i type this I have no idea what may happen or where our story leads,<br>but i have no doubt in my mind that we can make it through together.
            <br><br><span class="text-direct fw-bold">I love you Lisa.</span><br><br>Sincerely, <br>Your Secret Admirer 
            <br><span class="fs-6 fst-italic fw-light">That's all.<span class="text-direct"> I love you.</span> And I apoligize for taking this long to do this.</span>
